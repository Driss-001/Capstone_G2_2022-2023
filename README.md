# Capstone_G2_2022-2023: Developing a Near Infrared On Chip CO2 Sensor

This software project goal is to use the strong waveguide properties of a silicon ring resonator built on a microchip to create very acurate absorption spectra to be analysed by a raspberry pi


## Step 1 raspberry Pi + Desktop simulation
  
Control System centered around Rpi-4
